                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Saint Isidore Children's Center was founded in 2001 in Brgy. Punta, Calamba City, Laguna. Initially operating as a private tutorial service with one teacher and 20 pre-elementary students, the center quickly gained a reputation for high-quality education. Named after the barangay's patron saint, the center expanded its offerings to include pre-elementary to grade school programs.</p>
                <p>In 2007, a new school building was constructed to accommodate growing demand. The school achieved accreditation from the Department of Education (DepEd) and became a member of the Calamba City Private Schools Administrators Association and the Laguna Province Private Schools and Administrators Association (LAPPRISADA), an affiliate of NAPSPHIL. The school’s graduates have excelled in various professional fields, both locally and abroad, reflecting the strong educational foundation they received.</p>
